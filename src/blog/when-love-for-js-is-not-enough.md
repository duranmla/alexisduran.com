Some weeks ago, I was invited by my company to make a Talk related to a subject that I could choose. As that event aligned with one of the things I wanted to do this year I didn't doubt and I agree to be part of the event. While the video has been published within the company. The fact of sharing personal experiences makes me a little doubtful when I was thinking about publishing it on Internet. Nevertheless, trying to get the courage to do so I was approached for a co-worker in another department that told me:

> Hey Alexis! I saw your talk and I loved it!

To be honest, it was super meaningful to me that someone has decided to invest the time to listen to the talk encouraged by only free will. In that sense, this YouTube video publication pays tribute to that compliment. Thanks to all the people that help me out. Thanks to all the people that approach me and somehow compliment my talk.
